| [classDiagram.pdf](https://github.com/shreyasprabhudev/CS151-SJSU-Course-Planner/blob/main/diagrams/classdiagram.pdf) | UML class diagrams represent the structure of a system by showing the classes, their attributes, operations or methods, and the relationships among them. It illustrates the object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, abstraction, and association. Additionally, the UML class diagram also shows the access modifiers for class members such as public, private, and protected, which indicate the visibility and accessibility of the attributes and methods to other classes.  | 
| [useCaseDiagram.pdf](https://github.com/shreyasprabhudev/CS151-SJSU-Course-Planner/blob/main/diagrams/useCaseDiagram.pdf) | Use case diagrams represent the functional requirements of a system by illustrating the interactions between the system and its users or external entities. It is a sequence of actions performed by the user or the system to achieve a specific goal. The use case diagram depicts the users who interact with the system, use cases that the system provides, and the relationships between them. The users are represented as stick figures, while the use cases are represented as ovals. Their relationships are shown as solid lines, which indicates the communication or interaction between them. | 
| [stateDiagram.pdf](https://github.com/shreyasprabhudev/CS151-SJSU-Course-Planner/blob/main/diagrams/stateDiagram.pdf) | State diagrams represent the behavior of a system or an object by modeling its states and transitions between them. It states that the system can enter, depending on the user’s actions. They also depict the states as rectangles and transitions as arrows labeled with triggering events and conditions. It also includes entry and exit actions, composite states, and concurrent states. The purpose of the state diagram is to help understand the system’s dynamics and identify potential problems by modeling the behavior of complex systems. | 
| [sequenceDiagram.pdf]() | Sequence diagrams represent the interactions between objects in a system by illustrating the messages exchanged between them over time. To be more exact, it illustrates the interaction between the user, GUI, and system over time. The objects are shown in vertical lifelines and events (messages) as horizontal arrows between them. In this case, Students, Professors, Advisors, and Administrators are shown as the User. This diagram provides a dynamic view of the system’s behavior and is useful in system design, testing, and debugging. |
